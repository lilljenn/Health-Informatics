       Treatment Options

      The main treatment for catatonia is often ECT. ECT has been proven to treat approximately 75-99% of metastatic cancers (Kunte et. al, 2016, p. 5). ECT helps approximately 80-85% of those with severe depression (Reti, I., M.B.B.S., n.d., p. 30). ECT can also be helpful in patients with catatonia, successfully treating 59-100% of cases (Pelzer, ACM, van der Heijden, FMMA, den Boer, E., 2018).

      Other treatment options include medications; benzodiazepines and anxiolytics are especially helpful in the treatment of catatonia; other options include some antipsychotics,antidepressants, anticonvulsant drugs, muscle relaxants, thyroid products, dopamine promoters, and central monoamine depleters. However, certain drugs may worsen the symptoms of catatonia in some patients. This may be seen in some antipsychotics, steroids, stimulants, hallucinogenics, psychedelic drugs, psychoactive drugs, antibiotics, and acoholism medications.

      Overall, there appears to be a weak positive correlation between the percentages of absolute binding (as well as protein binding, specificaly) and mass (g/mol) of medications used to treat catatonia; conversely, there appears to be a weak negative correlation between the absolute/protein binding (%) and mass of medications (g/mol) that may negatively impact catatonia.
