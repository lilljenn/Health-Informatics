      Disease: Catatonia
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
      Catatonia is a serious mental health condition that can become life-threatening. From a medical perspective, catatonia can be classified into 3 different types: akinetic catatonia, excited catatonia, and malignant catatonia (Bhandari, S., MD, 2019). 
    </p>
    <p>
      Symptoms of catatonia depend on the type. Akinetic catatonia involves delayed motor movements and communication responses, while excited catatonia involves restlessness, agitation, and fast movements (Bhandari, S., MD, 2019). Malignant catatonia can be lethal without proper treatment due to changes in blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, breathing, and/or organ failure (Bhandari, S., MD, 2019). Malignant catatonia can arise from Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome, which stems from an irregular response to atypical antipsychotic medication (Wijdicks, E.F., MD, 2019). Catatonia (benign or malignant) could include increases in flexibility or stiffness (Bhandari, S., MD, 2019).
      Comorbidities to catatonia may be present in cancers and several mental illnesses, including psychosis, depression, anxiety, autism, and Alzheimer's (Bhandari, S., MD, 2019).

    <p>
      The primary deficits in a catatonia diagnosis are found in GRAMD4 and CNPase, which are both antibodies (Database, G., n.d. & Database, G., n.d.). GRAMD4 is responsible for E2F1-induced apoptosis, regulating cells and the immune system (John, K. et. al, 2011). Apoptosis is the body's natural defense system against viruses, radiation, and other forms of toxicity to the brain, in which brain cells die before the process of regeneration (Bergmann, A., & Steller, H., 2010). 
      However, abnormalities of this process may prevent regeneration, increasing abnormalities in other parts of the brain admist inflammation (Bergmann, A. & Steller, H., 2010). 
      GRAMD4 also regulates TLR9, which is responsible for regulating the immune system and nucleic acids (Kimura T. et. al, 2015). 
      The molecular structure for CNPase is 2',3'-cyclic-nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase, and CNPase is responsible for myelination, synaptogenesis, neurodevelopment, toxicity responses, and motor skills(Bal-Price et. al, 2018).
